# Welcome to Flatiron School!

 Welcome to Flatiron School (and to Learn). We are so glad you are here and a part of our team changing the face of education. 
 
 If you haven't used Learn before, here's how it works:
- The `Curriculum` menu (top-left) is your navigator. There are four levels of hierarchy:
  + ` Full Time Staff Onboarding` is a **track**.
  + `General Onboarding` is a **topic**.
  + `Welcome`, `Tasks`, and `Reading` are **units**.
  + Units contain **lessons**; a lesson is what you're currently reading.
- When you finish a lesson, click the `I'M DONE` button in the right-hand column, and then click `NEXT LESSON`.

If you have any questions, please reach out to Sarah, who is in charge of the onboarding process, via Slack (`@sarah.fox`) or email (`sarah.fox@flatironschool.com`).

Happy Learning!
